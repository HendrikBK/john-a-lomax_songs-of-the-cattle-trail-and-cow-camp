				<h3>THE COWBOY</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">HE wears a big hat and big spurs and all that,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And leggins of fancy fringed leather;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He takes pride in his boots and the pistol he shoots,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And he's happy in all kinds of weather;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He's fond of his horse, it's a broncho, of course,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">For oh, he can ride like the devil;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He is old for his years and he always appears</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Like a fellow who's lived on the level;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He can sing, he can cook, yet his eyes have the look</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Of a man that to fear is a stranger;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Yes, his cool, quiet nerve will always subserve</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">For his wild life of duty and danger.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He gets little to eat, and he guys tenderfeet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And for fashion, oh well! he's not in it;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He can rope a gay steer when he gets on its ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">At the rate of two-forty a minute;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">His saddle's the best in the wild, woolly West,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Sometimes it will cost sixty dollars;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Ah, he knows all the tricks when he brands mavericks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But his knowledge is not got from your scholars;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He is loyal as steel, but demands a square deal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And he hates and despises a coward;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Yet the cowboy, you'll find, to women is kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Though he'll fight till by death overpowered.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Hence I say unto you,— give the cowboy his due</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And be kind, my friends, to his folly;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">For he's generous and brave though he may not behave</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Like your dudes, who are so melancholy.</span>

				<h3>A RANGER</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">HE never made parade of tooth or claw;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He was plain as us that nursed the bawlin' herds.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Though he had a rather meanin'-lookin' jaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He was shy of exercisin' it with words.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">As a circus-ridin' preacher of the law,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">All his preachin' was the sort that hit the nail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He was just a common ranger, just a ridin' pilgrim stranger,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And he labored with the sinners of the trail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Once a Yaqui knifed a woman, jealous mad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then hit southward with the old, old killer's plan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And nobody missed the woman very bad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While they'd just a little rather missed the man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But the ranger crossed his trail and sniffed it glad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And then loped away to bring him back again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">For he stood for peace and order on the lonely, sunny border</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And his business was to hunt for sinful men!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">So the trail it led him southward all the day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Through the shinin' country of the thorn and snake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where the heat had drove the lizards from their play</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To the shade of rock and bush and yucca stake.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the mountains heaved and rippled far away</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the desert broiled as on the devil's prong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But he didn't mind the devil if his head kept clear and level</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the hoofs beat out their clear and steady song.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Came the yellow west, and on a far off rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Something black crawled up and dropped beyond the rim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And he reached his rifle out and rubbed his eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While he cussed the southern hills for growin' dim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Down a hazy 'royo came the coyote cries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Like they laughed at him because he'd lost his mark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the smile that brands a fighter pulled his mouth a little tighter</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">As he set his spurs and rode on through the dark.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Came the moonlight on a trail that wriggled higher</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Through the mountains that look into Mexico,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the shadows strung his nerves like banjo wire</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the miles and minutes dragged unearthly slow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then a black mesquite spit out a thread of fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the canyon walls flung thunder back again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And he caught himself and fumbled at his rifle while he grumbled</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That his bridle arm had weight enough for ten.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Though his rifle pointed wavy-like and slack</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And he grabbed for leather at his hawse's shy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Yet he sent a soft-nosed exhortation back</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That convinced the sinner — just above the eye.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">So the sinner sprawled among the shadows black</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While the ranger drifted north beneath the moon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Wabblin' crazy in his saddle, workin' hard to stay a-straddle</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While the hoofs beat out a slow and sorry tune.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">When the sheriff got up early out of bed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">How he stared and vowed his soul a total loss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">As he saw the droopy thing all blotched with red</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That came ridin' in aboard a tremblin' hawse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But "I got 'im" was the most the ranger said</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And you couldn't hire him, now, to tell the tale;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He was just a quiet ranger, just a ridin' pilgrim stranger</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And he labored with the sinners of the trail.</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i0">WHEN my loop takes hold on a two-year-old,</span>

						<span class="i1">By the feet or the neck or the horn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He kin plunge and fight till his eyes go white,</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Till he's happy to own he's broke.</span>

				<h3>THE DESERT</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">'TWAS the lean coyote told me, baring his slavish soul,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">As I counted the ribs of my dead cayuse and cursed at the desert sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The tale of the Upland Rider's fate while I dug in the water hole</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">For a drop, a taste of the bitter seep; but the water hole was dry!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">"He came," said the lean coyote, "and he cursed as his pony fell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And he counted his pony's ribs aloud; yea, even as you have done.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He raved as he ripped at the clay-red sand like an imp from the pit of hell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Shriveled with thirst for a thousand years and craving a drop — just one."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">"His name?" I asked, and he told me, yawning to hide a grin:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">"His name is writ on the prison roll and many a place beside;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Last, he scribbled it on the sand with a finger seared and thin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And I watched his face as he spelled it out — laughed as I laughed, and died.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">"And thus," said the lean coyote, "his need is the hungry's feast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And mine." I fumbled and pulled my gun — emptied it wild and fast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But one of the crazy shots went home and silenced the waiting beast;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">There lay the shape of the Liar, dead! 'Twas I that should laugh the last.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Laugh? Nay, now I would write my name as the Upland Rider wrote;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Write? What need, for before my eyes in a wide and wavering line</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I saw the trace of a written word and letter by letter float</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Into a mist as the world grew dark; and I knew that the name was mine.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Dreams and visions within the dream; turmoil and fire and pain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Hands that proffered a brimming cup — empty, ere I could take;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then the burst of a thunder-head — rain! It was rude, fierce rain!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Blindly down to the hole I crept, shivering, drenched, awake!</span>
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Dawn — and the edge of the red-rimmed sun scattering golden flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">As stumbling down to the water hole came the horse that I thought was dead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But never a sign of the other beast nor a trace of a rider's name;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Just a rain-washed track and an empty gun — and the old home trail ahead.</span>

						<span class="i0">All these have passed, and passed the immigrants,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Who bore the westward fever in their brain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The Norseman tang for roving in their veins;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Who loved the plains as sailors love the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Braved danger, death, and found a resting place</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While traveling on the old Mackenzie Trail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Brave old Mackenzie long has laid him down</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To rest beyond the trail that bears his name;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A granite mountain makes his monument;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The northers, moaning o'er the low divide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Go gently past his long deserted camps.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">No more his rangers guard the wild frontier,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">No more he leads them in the border fight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">No more the mavericks, winding stream of horns</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To Kansas bound; the dust, the cowboy songs</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And cries, the pistol's sharp report,— the free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Wild days in Texas by the Rio Grande.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And some men say when dusky night shuts down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Dark, cloudy nights without a kindly star,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">One sees dim horsemen skimming o'er the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Hard by Mackenzie's trail; and keener ears</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Have heard from deep within the bordering hills</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The tramp of ghostly hoofs, faint cattle lows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The rumble of a moving wagon train,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Sometimes far echoes of a frontier song;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then sounds grow fainter, shadows troop away,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">On westward, westward, as they in olden time</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Went rangeing o'er the old Mackenzie Trail.</span>

				<h3>THE SHEEP-HERDER<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">ALL day across the sagebrush flat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Beneath the sun of June,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">My sheep they loaf and feed and bleat</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Their never changin' tune.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And then, at night time, when they lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">As quiet as a stone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I hear the gray wolf far away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">"Alo-one!" he says, "Alo-one!"</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">A-a! ma-a! ba-a! eh-eh-eh!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The tune the woollies sing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">It's rasped my ears, it seems, for years,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Though really just since Spring;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And nothin', far as I can see</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Around the circle's sweep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But sky and plain, my dreams and me</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And them infernal sheep.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">I've got one book — it's poetry —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">A bunch of pretty wrongs</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An Eastern lunger gave to me;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He said 'twas "shepherd songs."</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But, though that poet sure is deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And has sweet things to say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He never seen a herd of sheep</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Or smelt them, anyway.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">A-a! ma-a! ba-a! eh-eh-eh!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">My woollies greasy gray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An awful change has hit the range</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Since that old poet's day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">For you're just silly, on'ry brutes</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And I look like distress,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And my pipe ain't the kind that toots</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And there's no "shepherdess."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Yet 'way down home in Kansas State,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Bliss Township, Section Five,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">There's one that's promised me to wait,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The sweetest girl alive;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That's why I salt my wages down</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And mend my clothes with strings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While others blow their pay in town</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">For booze and other things.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">A-a! ma-a! ba-a! eh-eh-eh!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">My Minnie, don't be sad;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Next year we'll lease that splendid piece</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That corners on your dad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">We'll drive to "literary," dear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The way we used to do</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And turn my lonely workin' here</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">To happiness for you.</span>
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Suppose, down near that rattlers' den,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">While I sit here and dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I'd spy a bunch of ugly men</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And hear a woman scream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Suppose I'd let my rifle shout</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And drop the men in rows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And then the woman should turn out —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">My Minnie! — just suppose.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">A-a! ma-a! ba-a! eh-eh-eh!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The tune would then be gay;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">There is, I mind, a parson kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Just forty miles away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Why, Eden would come back again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With sage and sheep corrals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And I could swing a singin' pen</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">To write her "pastorals."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">I pack a rifle on my arm</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And jump at flies that buzz;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">There's nothin' here to do me harm;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I sometimes wish there was.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">If through that brush above the pool</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">A red should creep — and creep —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Wah! cut down on 'im! — Stop, you fool!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That's nothin' but a sheep.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">A-a! ma-a! ba-a! — Hell!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Oh, sky and plain and bluff!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Unless my mail comes up the trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I'm locoed, sure enough.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">What's that? — a dust-whiff near the butte</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Right where my last trail ran,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A movin' speck, a — wagon! Hoot!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Thank God! here comes a man.</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i0">YES, o' cose it's interestin' to a feller from the range,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Mighty queerish, too, I tell you,— sich a racket fer a change;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">From a life among the cattle, from a wool shirt and the chaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To the biled shirt o' the city and the other tony traps.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Never seed sich herds o' people throwed together, every brand</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">O' humanity, I reckon, in this big mountain land</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Rounded up right here in Denver, runnin' on new sort o' feed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Actin' restless an' oneasy, like they threatened to stampede.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Mighty curious to a rider comin' from the range, he feels</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">What you'd call a lost sensation from sombrero clar to heels;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Like a critter stray that drifted in a windstorm from its range</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To another run o' grazin' where the brands it sees are strange.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then I see a city herder, a policeman, don't you know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Sort o' think he's got men spotted an' is 'bout to make a throw</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Fer to catch me an' corral me fer a stray till he can talk</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">On the wire an' tell the owner fer to come an' get his stock.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Yes, it's mighty strange an' funny fer a cowboy, as you say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Fer to hit a camp like this one, so unanimously gay;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But I want to tell you, pardner, that a rider sich as me</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Isn't built fer feedin' on sich crazy jamboree.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Every bone I got's a-achin', an' my feet as sore as if</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I had hit a bed o' cactus, an' my hinges is as stiff</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">From a-hittin' these hot pavements as a feller's jints kin git,—</span>

						<span class="i0">Where his home is in the saddle, an' the heavens is his roof,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' his ever'day companions wears the hide an' cloven hoof,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where the beller of the cattle is the only sound he hears,</span>

				<h3>THE OLD COWMAN</h3>

					<p>
						<span class="i0">I RODE across a valley range</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I hadn't seen for years.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The trail was all so spoilt and strange</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">It nearly fetched the tears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I had to let ten fences down,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">(The fussy lanes ran wrong)</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And each new line would make me frown</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And hum a mournin' song.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i2">Oh, it's squeak! squeak! squeak!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Hear 'em stretchin' of the wire!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The nester brand is on the land;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">I reckon I'll retire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">While progress toots her brassy horn</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And makes her motor buzz,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">I thank the Lord I wasn't born</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">No later than I wuz!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">'Twas good to live when all the sod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Without no fence nor fuss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Belonged in partnership to God,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The Government and us.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">With skyline bounds from east to west</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And room to go and come,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I loved my fellowman the best</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When he was scattered some.</span>
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i2">Oh, it's squeak! squeak! squeak!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Close and closer cramps the wire!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">There's hardly play to back away</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And call a man a liar.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Their house has locks on every door;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Their land is in a crate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">There ain't the plains of God no more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">They're only real estate.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">There's land where yet no ditchers dig</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Nor cranks experiment;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">It's only lovely, free and big</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And isn't worth a cent.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I pray that them who come to spoil</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">May wait till I am dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Before they foul that blessed soil</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">With fence and cabbage head.</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i2">Yet it's squeak! squeak! squeak!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Far and farther crawls the wire!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">To crowd and pinch another inch</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Is all their heart's desire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The world is over-stocked with men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And some will see the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">When each must keep his little pen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">But I'll be far away.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">When my old soul hunts range and rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Beyond the last divide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Just plant me in some stretch of West</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That's sunny, lone and wide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Let cattle rub my tombstone down</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And coyotes mourn their kin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Let hawses paw and tramp the moun',—</span>
						<br/>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i2">Oh, it's squeak! squeak! squeak!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And they pen the land with wire.</span>

						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Where we laughed round the fire.</span>
						<br/>

				<h3>THE GILA MONSTER ROUTE</h3>

					<p>
						<span class="i0">THE lingering sunset across the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Kissed the rear-end door of an east-bound train,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And shone on a passing track close by</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where a ding-bat sat on a rotting tie.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">He was ditched by a shock and a cruel fate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The con high-balled, and the manifest freight</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Pulled out on the stem behind the mail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And she hit the ball on a sanded rail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">As she pulled away in the falling light</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He could see the gleam of her red tail-light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then the moon arose and the stars came out —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He was ditched on the Gila Monster Route.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Nothing in sight but sand and space;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">No chance for a gink to feed his face;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Not even a shack to beg for a lump,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Or a hen-house to frisk for a single gump.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">He gazed far out on the solitude;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He drooped his head and began to brood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He thought of the time he lost his mate</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">In a hostile burg on the Nickle Plate.</span>
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">They had mooched the stem and threw their feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And speared four-bits on which to eat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But deprived themselves of daily bread</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And shafted their coin for "dago red."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Down by the track in the jungle's glade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">In the cool green grass, in the tules' shade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">They shed their coats and ditched their shoes</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And tanked up full of that colored booze.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Then they took a flop with their skins plumb full,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And they did not hear the harnessed bull,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Till he shook them out of their boozy nap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">With a husky voice and a loaded sap.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">They were charged with "vag," for they had no kale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the judge said, "Sixty days in jail."</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But the John had a bindle,— a worker's plea,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">So they gave him a floater and set him free.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">They had turned him up, but ditched his mate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">So he grabbed the guts of an east-bound freight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He flung his form on a rusty rod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Till he heard the shack say, "Hit the sod!"</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">The John piled off, he was in the ditch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">With two switch lamps and a rusty switch,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A poor, old, seedy, half-starved bo</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">On a hostile pike, without a show.</span>
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">From away off somewhere in the dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Came the sharp, short notes of a coyote's bark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The bo looked round and quickly rose</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And shook the dust from his threadbare clothes.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Off in the west through the moonlit night</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He saw the gleam of a big head-light —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An east-bound stock train hummed the rail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">She was due at the switch to clear the mail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">As she drew up close, the head-end shack</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Threw the switch to the passenger track,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The stock rolled in and off the main,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the line was clear for the west-bound train.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">When she hove in sight far up the track,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">She was workin' steam, with her brake shoes slack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">She hollered once at the whistle post,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then she flitted by like a frightened ghost.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">He could hear the roar of the big six-wheel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And her driver's pound on the polished steel,</span>
						<br/>

				<h3>A COWBOY TOAST</h3>

					<p>
						<span class="i0">HERE'S to the passing cowboy, the plowman's pioneer;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">His home, the boundless mesa, he of any man the peer;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Around his wide sombrero was stretched the rattler's hide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">His bridle sporting conchos, his lasso at his side.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">All day he roamed the prairies, at night he, with the stars,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Kept vigil o'er thousands held by neither posts nor bars;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">With never a diversion in all the lonesome land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But cattle, cattle, cattle, and sun and sage and sand.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Sometimes the hoot-owl hailed him, when scudding through the flat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And prairie dogs would sauce him, as at their doors they sat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The rattler hissed its warning when near its haunts he trod</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Some Texas steer pursuing o'er the pathless waste of sod.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">With lasso, quirt, and 'colter the cowboy knew his skill;</span>

						<span class="i0">They pass with him to history and naught their place can fill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While he, bold broncho rider, ne'er conned a lesson page,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But cattle, cattle, cattle, and sun and sand and sage.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">And oh! the long night watches, with terror in the skies!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When lightning played and mocked him till blinded were his eyes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When raged the storm around him, and fear was in his heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Lest panic-stricken leaders might make the whole herd start.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That meant a death for many, perhaps a wild stampede,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When none could stem the fury of the cattle in the lead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Ah, then life seemed so little and death so very near,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">With cattle, cattle, cattle, and darkness everywhere.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Then quaff with me a bumper of water, clear and pure,</span>

						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The cowgirls gay and the bronchos wild and the painted face of the Injun child.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He listened close for the fierce war-whoop, and his pent-up spirits began to droop,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And he wondered then if the hills and nooks held none of the sights of the story books.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">He'd hoped he would see the marshal pot some bold bad man with a pistol shot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And entered a low saloon by chance, where the tenderfoot is supposed to dance</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While the cowboy shoots at his bootheels there and the smoke of powder begrims the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But all was quiet as if he'd strayed to that silent spot where the dead are laid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Not even a faro game was seen, and none flaunted the long, long green.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">'Twas a blow for him who had come in quest of a touch of the real wild woolly West.</span>
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">He vainly sought for a bad cayuse and the swirl and swish of the flying noose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the cowboy's yell as he roped a steer, but nothing of this fell on his ear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Not even a wide-brimmed hat he spied, but derbies flourished on every side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the spurs and the "chaps" and the flannel shirts, the high-heeled boots and the guns and the quirts,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The cowboy saddles and silver bits and fancy bridles and swell outfits</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He'd read about in the novels grim, were not on hand for the likes of him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">He peered about for a stagecoach old, and a miner-man with a bag of gold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And a burro train with its pack-loads which he'd read they tie with the diamond hitch.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The rattler's whir and the coyote's wail ne'er sounded out as he hit the trail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And no one knew of a branding bee or a steer <ins class="transcriber" title="Transcriber’s note: unhyphenated in original.">roundup</ins> that he longed to see.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But the oldest settler named Six-Gun Sim rolled a cigarette and remarked to him:</span>
