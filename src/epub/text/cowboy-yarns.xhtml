				<h3>THE SHALLOWS OF THE FORD</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">DID you ever wait for daylight when the stars along the river</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Floated thick and white as snowflakes in the water deep and strange,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Till a whisper through the aspens made the current break and shiver</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As the frosty edge of morning seemed to melt and spread and change?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Once I waited, almost wishing that the dawn would never find me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Saw the sun roll up the ranges like the glory of the Lord;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Was about to wake my pardner who was sleeping close behind me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">When I saw the man we wanted spur his pony to the ford.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Saw the ripples of the shallows and the muddy streaks that followed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As the pony stumbled toward me in the narrows of the bend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Saw the face I used to welcome, wild and watchful, lined and hollowed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And God knows I wished to warn him, for I once had called him friend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">But an oath had come between us — I was paid by Law and Order;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He was outlaw, rustler, killer — so the border whisper ran;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Left his word in Caliente that he'd cross the Rio border —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Call me coward? But I hailed him — "Riding close to daylight, Dan!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Just a hair and he'd have got me, but my voice, and not the warning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Caught his hand and held him steady; then he nodded, spoke my name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Reined his pony round and fanned it in the bright and silent morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Back across the sunlit Rio up the trail on which he came.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">He had passed his word to cross it — I had passed my word to get him —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">We broke even and we knew it; 'twas a case of give and take</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">For old times. I could have killed him from the brush; instead, I let him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Ride his trail — I turned — my pardner flung his arm and stretched awake;</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Saw me standing in the open; pulled his gun and came beside me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Asked a question with his shoulder as his left hand pointed toward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Muddy streaks that thinned and vanished — not a word, but hard he eyed me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As the water cleared and sparkled in the shallows of the ford.</span>

					<span class="i0">Broncho Bill, he laughed and chewed and careless he did seem.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">The dance is done. Shots crack as one. The crowd shoves for the door.</span>

				<h3>THE LEGEND OF BOASTFUL BILL</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">AT a round-up on the Gila</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">One sweet morning long ago,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Ten of us was throwed quite freely</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">By a hoss from Idaho.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' we 'lowed he'd go a-beggin'</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">For a man to break his pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Till, a-hitchin' up one leggin',</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Boastful Bill cut loose an' cried:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">"I'm a ornery proposition for to hurt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">I fulfil my earthly mission with a quirt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">I can ride the highest liver</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">'Twixt the Gulf an' Powder River,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">An' I'll break this thing as easy as I'd flirt."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">So Bill climbed the Northern fury</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' they mangled up the air</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Till a native of Missouri</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Would have owned the brag was fair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Though the plunges kept him reelin'</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' the wind it flapped his shirt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Loud above the hoss's squealin'</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">We could hear our friend assert:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">"I'm the one to take such rockin's as a joke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Someone hand me up the makin's of a smoke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">If you think my fame needs brightnin',</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Why, I'll rope a streak o' lightnin'</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">An' spur it up an' quirt it till it's broke."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Then one caper of repulsion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Broke that hoss's back in two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Cinches snapped in the convulsion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Skyward man and saddle flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Up they mounted, never flaggin',</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And we watched them through our tears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">While this last, thin bit o' braggin'</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Came a-floatin' to our ears:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">"If you ever watched my habits very close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">You would know I broke such rabbits by the gross.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">I have kept my talent hidin',</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">I'm too good for earthly ridin',</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">So I'm off to bust the lightnin' — <ins class="transcriber" title="Transcriber’s note: original omits ó.">Adios</ins>!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Years have passed since that ascension;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Boastful Bill ain't never lit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">So we reckon he's a-wrenchin'</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Some celestial outlaw's bit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">When the night wind flaps our slickers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the rain is cold and stout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the lightnin' flares and flickers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">We can sometimes hear him shout:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">"I'm a ridin' son o' thunder o' the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">I'm a broncho twistin' wonder on the fly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Hey, you earthlin's, shut your winders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">We're a-rippin' clouds to flinders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">If this blue-eyed darlin' kicks at you, you die."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Star-dust on his chaps and saddle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Scornful still of jar and jolt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He'll come back sometime a-straddle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Of a bald-faced thunderbolt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the thin-skinned generation</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Of that dim and distant day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Sure will stare with admiration</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">When they hear old Boastful say:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">"I was first, as old raw-hiders all confest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">I'm the last of all rough riders, and the best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Huh! you soft and dainty floaters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">With your aeroplanes and motors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Huh! are you the greatgrandchildren of the West?"</span>

				<h3>THE TEXAS COWBOY AND THE<br/>
				MEXICAN GREASER</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I THINK we can all remember when a Greaser hadn't no show</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">In Palo Pinto particular,— it ain't very long ago;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A powerful feelin' of hatred ag'in the whole Greaser race</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That murdered bold Crockett and Bowie pervaded all in the place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Why, the boys would draw on a Greaser as quick as they would on a steer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">They was shot down without warnin' often, in the memory of many here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">One day the bark of pistols was heard ringin' out in the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And a Greaser, chased by some ranchmen, tore round here into the square.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I don't know what he's committed,—'tain't likely anyone knew,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But I wouldn't bet a check on the issue; if you knew the gang, neither would you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Breathless and bleeding, the Greaser fell down by the side of the wall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And a man sprang out before him,— a man both strong and tall,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">By his clothes I should say a cowboy,— a stranger in town, I think,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">With his pistol he waved back the gang, who was wild with rage and drink.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"I warn ye, get back!" he said, "or I'll blow your heads in two!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A dozen on one poor creature, and him wounded and bleeding, too!"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The gang stood back for a minute; then up spoke Poker Bill:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"Young man, yer a stranger, I reckon. We don't wish yer any ill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But come out of the range of the Greaser, or, as sure as I live, you'll croak;"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And he drew a bead on the stranger. I'll tell yer it wa'n't no joke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But the stranger moven' no muscle as he looked in the bore of Bill's gun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He hadn't no thought to stir, sir; he hadn't no thought to run;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But he spoke out cool and quiet, "I might live for a thousand year</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And not die at last so nobly as defendin' this Greaser here;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">For he's wounded, now, and helpless, and hasn't had no fair show;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the first of ye boys that strikes him, I'll lay that first one low."</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The gang respected the stranger that for another was willing to die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">They respected the look of daring they saw in that cold, blue eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">They saw before them a hero that was glad in the right to fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And he was a Texas cowboy,— never heard of Rome at all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Don't tell me of yer Romans, or yer bridge bein' held by three;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">True manhood's the same in Texas as it was in Rome, d'ye see?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Did the Greaser escape? Why certain. I saw the hull crowd over thar</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">At the ranch of Bill Simmons, the gopher, with their glasses over the bar.</span>

					<span class="i0">An' the whiskey joints and the faro games</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' a-shakin' our hoofs with the dance hall dames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Made a wholesale bust; an', pard, I'll be cussed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">If a man in the outfit had any dust.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' so I explained, but the youth replied</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That he'd lay the money matter aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' to show that his back didn't grow no moss</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He'd bet his machine against my hoss.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I tuk him up, an' the bet war closed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' me a-chucklin', fer I supposed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I war playin' in dead-sure, winnin' luck</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">In the softest snap I had ever struck.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' the boys chipped in with a knowin' grin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Fer they thought the fool had no chance to win.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' so we agreed fer to run that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To the Navajo cross, ten miles away,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As handsome a track as you ever seed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Fer testin' a hosses prettiest speed.</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Apache Johnson and Texas Ned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Saddled up their hosses an' rode ahead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To station themselves ten miles away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' act as judges an' see fair play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">While Mexican Bart and big Jim Hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Stayed back fer to give us an even start.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I got aboard of my broncho bird</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' we came to the scratch an' got the word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' I laughed till my mouth spread from ear to ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To see that tenderfoot drop to the rear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">The first three miles slipped away first-rate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Then bronc began fer to lose his gait.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But I warn't oneasy an' didn't mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">With tenderfoot more'n a mile behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">So I jogged along with a cowboy song</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Till all of a sudden I heard that gong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A-ringin' a warnin' in my ear —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0"><i>Ting, ting, ting, ting,</i>— too infernal near;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' lookin' backwards I seen that chump</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Of a tenderfoot gainin' every jump.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I hit old bronc a cut with the quirt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' once more got him to scratchin' dirt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But his wind got weak, an' I tell you, boss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I seen he wasn't no ten-mile hoss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Still, the plucky brute took another shoot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' pulled away from the wheel galoot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But the animal couldn't hold his gait;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' the idea somehow entered my pate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That if tenderfoot's legs didn't lose their grip</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He'd own that hoss at the end of the trip.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Closer an' closer come tenderfoot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' harder the whip to the hoss I put;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But the Eastern cuss, with a smile on his face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Ran up to my side with his easy pace —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Rode up to my side, an' dern his hide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Remarked 'twere a pleasant day fer a ride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Then axed, onconcerned, if I had a match,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' on his britches give it a scratch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Lit a cigarette, said he wished me good-day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' as fresh as a daisy scooted away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Ahead he went, that infernal gong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A-ringin' "good-day" as he flew along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' the smoke from his cigarette came back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Like a vaporous snicker along his track.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">On an' on he sped, gettin' further ahead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">His feet keepin' up that onceaseable tread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Till he faded away in the distance, an' when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I seed the condemned Eastern rooster again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He war thar with the boys at the end of the race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That same keerless, onconsarned smile on his face.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Now, pard, when a cowboy gits licked he don't swar</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Nor kick, if the beatin' are done on the squar;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">So I tuck that Easterner right by the hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' told him that broncho awaited his brand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Then I axed him his name, an' where from he came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' how long he'd practiced that wheel-rollin' game.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Tom Stevens he said war his name, an' he come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">From a town they call Bosting, in old Yankeedom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Then he jist paralyzed us by sayin' he'd whirled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That very identical wheel round the world.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Wal, pard, that's the story of how that smart chap</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Done me up w'en I thought I had sich a soft snap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Done me up on a race with remarkable ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' lowered my pride a good many degrees.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Did I give him the hoss? W'y o' course I did, boss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' I tell you it warn't no diminutive loss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He writ me a letter from back in the East,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An' said he presented the neat little beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To a feller named Pope, who stands at the head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">O' the ranch where the cussed wheel hosses are bred.</span>

				<h3>RIDERS OF THE STARS</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">TWENTY abreast down the Golden Street ten thousand riders marched;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Bow-legged boys in their swinging chaps, all clumsily keeping time;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the Angel Host to the lone, last ghost their delicate eyebrows arched</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As the swaggering sons of the open range drew up to the throne sublime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Gaunt and grizzled, a Texas man from out of the concourse strode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And doffed his hat with a rude, rough grace, then lifted his eagle head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The sunlit air on his silvered hair and the bronze of his visage glowed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"Marster, the boys have a talk to make on the things up here," he said.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">A hush ran over the waiting throng as the Cherubim replied:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"He that readeth the hearts of men He deemeth your challenge strange,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Though He long hath known that ye crave your own, that ye would not walk but ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Oh, restless sons of the ancient earth, ye men of the open range!"</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Then warily spake the Texas man: "A petition and no complaint</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">We here present, if the Law allows and the Marster He thinks it fit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">We-all agree to the things that be, but we're longing for things that ain't,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">So we took a vote and we made a plan and here is the plan we writ: —</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">"<i>'Give us a range and our horses and ropes, open the Pearly Gate,</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>And turn us loose in the unfenced blue riding the sunset rounds,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>Hunting each stray in the Milky Way and running the Rancho straight;</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>Not crowding the dogie stars too much on their way to the bedding-grounds.</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">"<i>'Maverick comets that's running wild, we'll rope 'em and brand 'em fair,</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>So they'll quit stampeding the starry herd and scaring the folks below,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>And we'll save 'em prime for the round-up time, and we riders'll all be there,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>Ready and willing to do our work as we did in the long ago.</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">"<i>'We've studied the Ancient Landmarks, Sir; Taurus, the Bear, and Mars,</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>And Venus a-smiling across the west as bright as a burning coal,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>Plain to guide as we punchers ride night-herding the little stars,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>With Saturn's rings for our home corral and the Dipper our water hole.</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">"<i>'Here, we have nothing to do but yarn of the days that have long gone by,</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>And our singing it doesn't fit in up here though we tried it for old time's sake;</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span class="i0">
						<i>Our hands are itching to swing a rope and our legs are stiff; that's why</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span class="i0"><i>We ask you, Marster, to turn us loose — just give us an even break!'</i>"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Then the Lord He spake to the Cherubim, and this was His kindly word:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"He that keepeth the threefold keys shall open and let them go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Turn these men to their work again to ride with the starry herd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">My glory sings in the toil they crave; 'tis their right. I would have it so."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Have you heard in the starlit dusk of eve when the lone coyotes roam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The <i>Yip!</i> <i>Yip!</i> <i>Yip!</i> of a hunting cry and the echo that shrilled afar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As you listened still on a desert hill and gazed at the twinkling dome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And a viewless rider swept the sky on the trail of a shooting star?</span>

				<h3>LASCA</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I WANT free life, and I want fresh air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And I sigh for the canter after the cattle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The crack of the whips like shots in battle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The medley of hoofs and horns and heads</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That wars and wrangles and scatters and spreads;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The green beneath and the blue above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And dash and danger, and life and love —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And Lasca!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i6">Lasca used to ride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">On a mouse-grey mustang close to my side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">With blue serape and bright-belled spur;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I laughed with joy as I looked at her!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Little knew she of books or creeds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An Ave Maria sufficed her needs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Little she cared save to be at my side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To ride with me, and ever to ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">From San Saba's shore to Lavaca's tide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She was as bold as the billows that beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She was as wild as the breezes that blow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">From her little head to her little feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She was swayed in her suppleness to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">By each gust of passion; a sapling pine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That grows on the edge of a Kansas bluff</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And wars with the wind when the weather is rough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Is like this Lasca, this love of mine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She would hunger that I might eat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Would take the bitter and leave me the sweet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But once, when I made her jealous for fun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">At something I whispered or looked or done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">One Sunday, in San Antonio,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To a glorious girl in the Alamo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She drew from her garter a little dagger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And — sting of a wasp — it made me stagger!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">An inch to the left, or an inch to the right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And I shouldn't be maundering here tonight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But she sobbed, and sobbing, so quickly bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her torn rebosa about the wound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That I swiftly forgave her. Scratches don't count</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">In Texas, down by the Rio Grande.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Her eye was brown — a deep, deep brown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her hair was darker than her eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And something in her smile and frown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Curled crimson lip and instep high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Showed that there ran in each blue vein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Mixed with the milder Aztec strain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The vigorous vintage of Old Spain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She was alive in every limb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">With feeling, to the finger tips;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And when the sun is like a fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And sky one shining, soft sapphire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">One does not drink in little sips.</span>

					<span class="i0">The air was heavy, the night was hot,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Forgot the herd that were taking their rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Forgot that the air was close oppressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That the Texas norther comes sudden and soon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">In the dead of the night or the blaze of the noon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">That, once let the herd at its breath take fright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Nothing on earth can stop their flight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And woe to the rider, and woe to the steed,</span>

					<span class="i0">Of my swift mustang without a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I sprang to the saddle, and she clung behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Away! on a hot chase down the wind!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But never was fox-hunt half so hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And never was steed so little spared.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i2">In Texas, down by the Rio Grande.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">The mustang flew, and we urged him on;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">There was one chance left, and you have but one —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Halt, jump to the ground, and shoot your horse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Crouch under his carcass, and take your chance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And if the steers in their frantic course</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Don't batter you both to pieces at once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">You may thank your star; if not, goodbye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the open air and the open sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">In Texas, down by the Rio Grande.</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">The cattle gained on us, and, just as I felt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">For my old six-shooter behind in my belt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Down came the mustang, and down came we,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Clinging together — and, what was the rest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A body that spread itself on my breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Two arms that shielded my dizzy head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Two lips that hard to my lips were prest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Then came thunder in my ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As over us surged the sea of steers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Blows that beat blood into my eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And when I could rise —</span>
					<br/>

				<p>
					<span class="i0">
						<span class="dots">· · · · · · ·</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I gouged out a grave a few feet deep,</span>

					<span class="i0">Stately and still, like a ship at sea.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i0">For the things that are, like the things that were.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Does half my heart lie buried there</span>

				<h3>THE TRANSFORMATION OF A TEXAS<br/>
				GIRL</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">SHE was a Texas maiden, she came of low degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her clothes were worn and faded, her feet from shoes were free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her face was tanned and freckled, her hair was sun-burned, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her whole darned <i>tout ensemble</i> was painful for to view!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She drove a lop-eared mule team attached unto a plow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The trickling perspiration exuding from her brow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And often she lamented her cruel, cruel fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As but a po' white's daughter down in the Lone Star State.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">No courtiers came to woo her, she never had a beau,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her misfit face precluded such things as that, you know,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She was nobody's darling, no feller's solid girl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And poets never called her an uncut Texas pearl.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her only two companions was those two flea-bit mules,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The wondrous world she'd heard of, to her was but a dream</span>

					<span class="i0">As walked she in the furrows behind that lop-eared team.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Born on that small plantation, 'twas there she thought she'd die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">She never longed for pinions that she might rise and fly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To other lands far distant, where breezes fresh and cool</span>

					<span class="i0">Would never shake and tremble from brayings of a mule.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Great sparkling, flashing brilliants that hung as frozen tears!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The feet once nude and soil-stained were clad in Frenchy boots,</span>

					<span class="i0">The voice that once admonished the mules to move along</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Had rested there for ages above a flow of oil?</span>

				<p>

					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"Careful? You foolish darling!"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">How tenderly it was said!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">What a smile shone through the chalk and paint!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"I love each hair of his head!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">The noise rose into an uproar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Misrule for the time was king;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The clown with a foolish chuckle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Bolted into the ring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But as, with a squeak and flourish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The fiddles closed their tune</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"You'll hold him as if he were made of glass?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Said the clown to the pantaloon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">The jovial fellow nodded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"I've a couple myself," he said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"I know how to handle 'em, bless you!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Old fellow, go ahead!"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The fun grew fast and furious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And not one of all the crowd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Had guessed that the baby was alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">When he suddenly laughed aloud.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Oh, that baby laugh! It was echoed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">From the benches with a ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the roughest customer there sprang up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">With, "Boys, it's the real thing."</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The ring was jammed in a minute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Not a man that did not strive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">For a "shot at holding the baby,"—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The baby that was alive!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">He was thronged with kneeling suitors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">In the midst of the dusty ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And he held his court right royally,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The fair little baby king,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Till one of the shouting courtiers,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A man with a bold, hard face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The talk, for miles, of the country,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the terror of the place,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Raised the little king to his shoulder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And chuckled, "Look at that!"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As the chubby fingers clutched his hair;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Then, "Boys, hand round the hat!"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">There never was such a hatful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Of silver and gold and notes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">People are not always penniless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Because they don't wear coats.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">And then, "Three cheers for the baby!"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I tell you those cheers were meant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the way that they were given</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Was enough to raise the tent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And then there was sudden silence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And a gruff old miner said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"Come boys, enough of this rumpus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">It's time it was put to bed."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">So, looking a little sheepish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But with faces strangely bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The audience, somewhat lingering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Flocked out into the night.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the bold-faced leader chuckled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"He wasn't a bit afraid!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He's as game as he's good-looking!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Boys, that was a show that <i>paid!</i>"</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And where he lies the vulture knows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Along the Tinto River.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">In schools of eastern culture pale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">My cloistered flesh began to fail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">They bore me where the deserts quail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To winds from out the sun.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I looked upon the land and sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Nor hoped to live nor feared to die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And from my hollow breast a sigh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Fell o'er the burning waste.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">But strong I grew and tall I grew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I drank the region's balm and dew,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">It made me lithe in limb and thew,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">How swift I rode and ran!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">And oft it was my joy to ride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Over the sand-blown ocean wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">While, ever smiling at my side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Rode Marta of Milrone.</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">A flood of horned heads before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The trampled thunder, smoke and roar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Of full four thousand hoofs, or more —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A cloud, a sea, a storm!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Oh, wonderful the desert gleamed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">As, man and maid, we spoke and dreamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Of love in life, till white wastes seemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Like plains of paradise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Her eyes with Love's great magic shone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"Be mine, O Marta of Milrone,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Your hand, your heart be all my own!"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her lips made sweet response.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">"I love you, yes; for you are he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Who from the East should come to me —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And I have waited long!" Oh, we</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Were happy as the sun.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">There came upon a hopeless quest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">With hell and hatred in his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A stranger, who his love confessed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To Marta long in vain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">To me she spoke: "Chosen mate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">His eyes are terrible with fate,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I fear his love, I fear his hate,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I fear some looming ill!"</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Then to the church we twain did ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I kissed her as she rode beside.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">How fair — how passing fair my bride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">With gold combs in her hair!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Before the Spanish priest we stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Of San Gregorio's brotherhood —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A shot rang out! — and in her blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">My dark-eyed darling lay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">O God! I carried her beside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The Virgin's altar where she cried,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Smiling upon me ere she died,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"Adieu, my love, adieu!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I knelt before St. Mary's shrine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And held my dead one's hand in mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"Vengeance," I cried, "O Lord, be thine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But I thy minister!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I kissed her thrice and sealed my vow,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Her eyes, her sea-cold lips and brow,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"Farewell, my heart is dying now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">O Marta of Milrone!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Then swift upon my steed I lept;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">My streaming eyes the desert swept;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I saw the accursed where he crept</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Against the blood-red sun.</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I galloped straight upon his track,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And never more my eyes looked back;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The world was barred with red and black;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">My heart was flaming coal.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Through the delirious twilight dim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the black night I followed him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Hills did we cross and rivers swim,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">My fleet foot horse and I.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">The morn burst red, a gory wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">O'er iron hills and savage ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And there was never another sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Save beat of horses' hoofs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Unto the murderer's ear they said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">"<i>Thou'rt of the dead! Thou'rt of the dead!</i>"</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Still on his stallion black he sped</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">While death spurred on behind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Fiery dust from the blasted plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Burnt like lava in every vein;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">But I rode on with steady rein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Though the fierce sand-devils spun.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Then to a sullen land we came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Whose earth was brass, whose sky was flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I made it balm with her blessed name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">In the land of Mexico.</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">With gasp and groan my poor horse fell, —</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Last of all things that loved me well!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I turned my head — a smoking shell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Veiled me his dying throes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">But fast on vengeful foot was I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">His steed fell, too, and was left to die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He fled where a river's channel dry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Made way to the rolling stream.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Red as my rage the huge sun sank.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">My foe bent low on the river's bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And deep of the kindly flood he drank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">While the giant stars broke forth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Then face to face and man to man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I fought him where the river ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">While the trembling palm held up its fan</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the emerald serpents lay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">The mad, remorseless bullets broke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">From tongues of flame in the sulphur smoke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The air was rent till the desert spoke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">To the echoing hills afar.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Hot from his lips the curses burst;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">He fell! The sands were slaked of thirst;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">A stream in the stream ran dark at first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And the stones grew red as hearts.</span>
					<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">I shot him where the Rio flows;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">I shot him when the moon arose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And where he lies the vulture knows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Along the Tinto River.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">But where she lies to none is known</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Save to my poor heart and a lonely stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">On which I sit and weep alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">Where the cactus stars are white.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i0">Where I shall lie, no man can say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">The flowers all are fallen away;</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i0">And a feller could "mav'rick" and stay out of jail.</span>

					<span class="i0">Then here's to the eyes that like diamonds are gleaming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And make the lamps blush that their duties are o'er;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And here's to the lips where young love lies a-dreaming;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And here's to the feet light as air on the floor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And here's to the memories — fun's sweetest sequel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And here's to the night we shall ever recall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">And here's to the time — time shall know not its equal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i0">When we danced the day in at the Cattlemen's Ball.</span>
