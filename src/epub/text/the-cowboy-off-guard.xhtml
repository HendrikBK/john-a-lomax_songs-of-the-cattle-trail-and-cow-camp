						<span class="i0">Then rosins up the tight-drawn hairs, the young folks in a fret<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Until their ears are greeted with the warning words, "All set!<br/></span>
						<span class="i2">S'lute yer pardners! Let 'er go!<br/></span>
						<span class="i2">Balance all an' do-ce-do!<br/></span>

						<span class="i0">An' thus the merry dance went on till morning's struggling light<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">In lengthening streaks of grey breaks down the barriers of the night,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">And broncs are mounted in the glow of early morning skies<br/></span>

						<span class="i0">The girls within their chambers hide their sleep like weary birds,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">And for a week the young folks talk of what a jolly spree<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">They had that night at Jackson's ranch down on the Owyhee.<br/></span>
