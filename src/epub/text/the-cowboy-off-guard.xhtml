				<h3>A COWBOY'S WORRYING LOVE</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">I UST to read in the novel books 'bout fellers that got the prod</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">From an arrer shot from his hidin' place by the hand o' the Cupid god,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' I'd laugh at the cussed chumps they was a-wastin' their breath in sighs</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' goin' around with a locoed look a-campin' inside their eyes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I've read o' the gals that broke 'em up a-sailin' in airy flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">On angel pinions above their beds as they dreampt o' the same at night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' a sort o' disgusted frown'd bunch the wrinkles acrost my brow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' I'd call 'em a lot o' sissy boys — but I'm seein' it different now.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">I got the jab in my rough ol' heart, an' I got it a-plenty, too,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A center shot from a pair o' eyes of the winninest sort o' blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' I ride the ranges a-sighin' sighs, as cranky as a locoed steer —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A durned heap worse than the novel blokes that the narrative gals'd queer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Just hain't no energy left no mo', go 'round like a orphant calf</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A-thinkin' about that sagehen's eyes that give me the Cupid gaff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' I'm all skeered up when I hit the thought some other rider might</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Cut in ahead on a faster hoss an' rope her afore my sight.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">There ain't a heifer that ever run in the feminine beauty herd</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Could switch a tail on the whole durned range 'long-side o' that little bird;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A figger plump as a prairy dog's that's feedin' on new spring grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' as purty a face as was ever flashed in front of a lookin' glass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">She's got a smile that 'd raise the steam in the icyist sort o' heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A couple o' soul inspirin' eyes, an' the nose that keeps 'em apart</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Is the cutest thing in the sassy line that ever occurred to act</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">As a ornament stuck on a purty face, an' that's a dead open fact.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">I'm a-goin' to brace her by an' by to see if there's any hope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To see if she's liable to shy when I'm ready to pitch the rope;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To see if she's goin' to make a stand, or fly like a skeered up dove</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When I make a pass with the brandin' iron that's het in the fire o' love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I'll open the little home corral an' give her the level hunch</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To make a run fur the open gate when I cut her out o' the bunch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Fur there ain't no sense in a-jammin' round with a heart that's as soft as dough</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' a-throwin' the breath o' life away bunched up into sighs. Heigh-ho!</span>

				<h3>THE COWBOY'S DANCE SONG</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">YOU can't expect a cowboy to agitate his shanks</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">In etiquettish manner in aristocratic ranks</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When he's always been accustomed to shake the heel and toe</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">At the rattling rancher dances where much etiquet don't go.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">You can bet I set them laughing in quite an excited way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">A-giving of their squinters an astonished sort of play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When I happened into Denver and was asked to take a prance</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">In the smooth and easy mazes of a high-toned dance.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">When I got among the ladies in their frocks of fleecy white,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the dudes togged out in wrappings that were simply out of sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Tell you what, I was embarrassed, and somehow I couldn't keep</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">From feeling like a burro in a pretty flock of sheep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Every step I made was awkward and I blushed a fiery red</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Like the principal adornment of a turkey gobbler's head.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The ladies said 'twas seldom that they had had the chance</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To see an old-time puncher at a high-toned dance.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">I cut me out a heifer from a bunch of pretty girls</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And yanked her to the center to dance the dreamy whirls.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">She laid her head upon my bosom in a loving sort of way</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And we drifted into heaven as the band began to play.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I could feel my neck a-burning from her nose's breathing heat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And she do-ce-doed around me, half the time upon my feet;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">She peered up in my blinkers with a soul-dissolving glance</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Quite conducive to the pleasures of a high-toned dance.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">Every nerve just got a-dancing to the music of delight</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">As I hugged the little sagehen uncomfortably tight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">But she never made a bellow and the glances of her eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Seemed to thank me for the pleasure of a genuine surprise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">She snuggled up against me in a loving sort of way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And I hugged her all the tighter for her trustifying play,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Tell you what the joys of heaven ain't a cussed circumstance</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">To the hug-a-mania pleasures of a high-toned dance.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">When they struck the old cotillion on the music bill of fare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Every bit of devil in me seemed to burst out on a tear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I fetched a cowboy whoop and started in to rag,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And cut her with my trotters till the floor began to sag;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Swung my pardner till she got sea-sick and rushed for a seat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I balanced to the next one but she dodged me slick and neat.—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Tell you what, I shook the creases from my go-to-meeting pants</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When I put the cowboy trimmings on that high-toned dance.</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i0">WAY out in Western Texas, where the Clear Fork's waters flow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where the cattle are "a-browzin'" and the Spanish ponies grow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where the Norther "comes a-whistlin'" from beyond the Neutral strip</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the prairie dogs are sneezin', as if they had "the Grip";</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where the coyotes come a-howlin' round the ranches after dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the mocking-birds are singin' to the lovely "medder lark";</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where the 'possum and the badger, and rattle-snakes abound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the monstrous stars are winkin' o'er a wilderness profound;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where lonesome, tawny prairies melt into airy streams,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">While the Double Mountains slumber in heavenly kinds of dreams;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where the antelope is grazin' and the lonely plovers call —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">It was there that I attended "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball."</span>
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">The town was Anson City, old Jones's county seat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where they raise Polled Angus cattle, and waving whiskered wheat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where the air is soft and "bammy," an' dry an' full of health,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And the prairies is explodin' with agricultural wealth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where they print the <i>Texas Western</i>, that Hec. McCann supplies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">With news and yarns and stories, of most amazin' size;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where Frank Smith "pulls the badger," on knowin' tender feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And Democracy's triumphant, and mighty hard to beat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Where lives that good old hunter, John Milsap from Lamar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Who "used to be the sheriff, back East, in Paris, sah!"</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">'Twas there, I say, at Anson, with the lively "Widder Wall,"</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That I went to that reception, "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The ladies — "kinder scatterin'" — had gathered in for miles.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And yet the place was crowded, as I remember well,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">'Twas got for the occasion at "The Morning Star Hotel."</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The music was a fiddle and a lively tambourine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And a "viol come imported," by stage from Abilene.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The room was togged out gorgeous — with mistletoe and shawls,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And candles flickered frescoes around the airy walls.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The "wimmin folks" looked lovely — the boys looked kinder treed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Till their leader commenced yellin': "Whoa, fellers, let's stampede."</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The music started sighin' and a-wailin' through the hall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">As a kind of introduction to "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball."</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">The leader was a fellow that came from Swenson's Ranch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">They called him "Windy Billy," from "little Dead-man's Branch."</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">His rig was "kinder keerless," big spurs and high-heeled boots;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">He had the reputation that comes when "fellers shoots."</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">His voice was like the bugle upon the mountain's height;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">His feet were animated, an' a <i>mighty movin' sight</i>,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">When he commenced to holler, "Neow, fellers, stake yer pen!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Lock horns to all them heifers, an' russle 'em like men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Saloot yer lovely critters; neow swing an' let 'em go,</span>

						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Huh! hit wuz gittin' happy, "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball!"</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">The boys were tolerable skittish, the ladies powerful neat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That old bass viol's music <i>just got there with both feet</i>.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">That wailin' frisky fiddle, I never shall forget;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And Windy kept a singin' — I think I hear him yet —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">"O Xes, chase your squirrels, an' cut 'em to one side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Spur Treadwell to the center, with Cross P Charley's bride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Doc. Hollis down the middle, an' twine the ladies' chain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Varn Andrews pen the fillies in big T. Diamond's train.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">All pull yer freight tergether, neow swallow fork an' change,</span>

						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Huh! hit wuz gittin' active — "The Cowboys' Christmas Ball!"</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i0">The dust riz fast an' furious, we all just galloped round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Till the scenery got so giddy, that Z Bar Dick was downed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">We buckled to our partners, an' told 'em to hold on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then shook our hoofs like lightning until the early dawn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Don't tell me 'bout cotillions, or germans. No sir 'ee!</span>

						<span class="i0">That whirl at Anson City just takes the cake with me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I'm sick of lazy shufflin's, of them I've had my fill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Give me a fronteer breakdown, backed up by Windy Bill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">McAllister ain't nowhere! when Windy leads the show,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">I've seen 'em both in harness, an' so I sorter know —</span>

				<h3>A DANCE AT THE RANCH</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<span class="i0">FROM every point they gaily come, the broncho's unshod feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Pat at the green sod of the range with quick, emphatic beat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The tresses of the buxom girls as banners stream behind —</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Like silken, castigating whips cut at the sweeping wind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The dashing cowboys, brown of face, sit in their saddle thrones</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And sing the wild songs of the range in free, uncultured tones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Or ride beside the pretty girls, like gallant cavaliers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And pour the usual fairy tales into their list'ning ears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Within the "best room" of the ranch the jolly gathered throng</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Buzz like a hive of human bees and lade the air with song;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The maidens tap their sweetest smiles and give their tongues full rein</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">In efforts to entrap the boys in admiration's chain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The fiddler tunes the strings with pick of thumb and scrape of bow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Finds one string keyed a note too high, another one too low;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Then rosins up the tight-drawn hairs, the young folks in a fret</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">Until their ears are greeted with the warning words, "All set!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">S'lute yer pardners! Let 'er go!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Balance all an' do-ce-do!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Swing yer girls an' run away!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Right an' left an' gents sashay!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Gents to right an' swing or cheat!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">On to next gal an' repeat!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Balance next an' don't be shy!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Swing yer pard an' swing 'er high!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Bunch the gals an' circle round!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Whack yer feet until they bound!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Form a basket! Break away!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Swing an' kiss an' all git gay!</span>

						<span class="i2">Swing yer op'sites! Swing agin!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Kiss the sagehens if you kin!"</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">An' thus the merry dance went on till morning's struggling light</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">In lengthening streaks of grey breaks down the barriers of the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">And broncs are mounted in the glow of early morning skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">By weary-limbed young revelers with drooping, sleepy eyes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The cowboys to the ranges speed to "work" the lowing herds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i0">The girls within their chambers hide their sleep like weary birds,</span>
						<br/>
